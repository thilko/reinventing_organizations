== Self-management - Processes
=== Advice process
Everyone in the organization can take every decision. But before doing so, the person must seek advice from
all affected parties. There is no obligation to integrate every piece of advice.
[NOTE.speaker]
--
important: you need public information for that!

[NOTE.speaker]

in teal there is no strategy process
instead people have a clear understanding of it´s purpose and a broad direction the
organization is heading to.
Strategy happens organically all the time
--

=== Planning, budgeting, and controlling
* sense and respond instead of predict and control
* workable solution instead of best possible solution

=== !
[quote, Frederic Laloux]
In complicated systems, we can try to figure out *the best* solution. In complex systems, we need workable solutions and fast iterations.

=== No targets

--
targets are mostly guesswork, live and circumstances changes so fast
targets can be self set from the people - if they find it useful
