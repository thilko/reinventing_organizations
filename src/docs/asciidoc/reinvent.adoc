* All "first tier" stages consider that their worldview is the only valid one
* Every stage is adopted to it´s context
* Every paradigm includes and transcends the previous
* There are many dimensions: cognitive, moral, social, spiritual ...

=== Shifting stages
[quote, Frederic Laloux]
According to the research, the trigger for vertical growth always comes in the form of a major life challenge
that cannot be resolved from the current worldview.

=== ... from **first tier** to **second tier**

[quote, John Naisbitt, American speaker and public author in the area of future studies]

all affected parties. There is no obligation to integrate every piece of advice.

* Peer-based processed and self-set salaries

* Misperception #3: It´s about empowerment
* Misperception #4: It´s still experimental

video::nya4dnfAKjs[youtube, width=800, height=600]

=== From self-preservation to...

=== ... what is truly worth achieving?

... when an organization truly lives sfor its purpose, there is no competition.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Example with buurtzorg: helps the competitors.
--

=== Practices to listen in to evolutionary purpose
* Sensing
* The empty chair
* Large group processes (Appreciative Inquiry, Open Space, Future Search)
* Meditation

=== Strategy as an organic process
[NOTE.speaker]
--
instead people have a clear understanding of it´s purpose and a broad direction the
organization is heading to.
--

=== Planning, budgeting, and controlling
* sense and respond instead of predict and control
* workable solution instead of best possible solution

=== !
[quote, Frederic Laloux]
In complicated systems, we can try to figure out *the best* solution. In complex systems, we need workable solutions and fast iterations.

=== No targets
[NOTE.speaker]
--
targets are mostly guesswork, live and circumstances changes so fast
targets can be self set from the people - if they find it useful
--

=== Culture

== Transforming an existing organization
=== Necessary conditions
* Does the CEO see the world through Teal lenses?
* Do the members of the board get it?

=== Introducing self-management
* You need psychologically ownership
* Purpose, emulation, market pressure

=== Approaches
* Creative chaos
* Bottom-up redesign
* Pre-existing template

=== Thx.
